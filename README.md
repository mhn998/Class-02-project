## Synopsis 

A web page that tells briefly about the author of the web page (Muhannad) & makes a user interact with 5 guessing questions about the author of the page to engage him with some suspense. 

Adds another 2 guess games, the first is about guessing number and the second is about guessing the favorite food. 

I wraped the code with functions. I was the driver (Ala'a) and Muhannad was the navigator. 

## Code Examples 

I used various javascript tools such as loops & conditional along with prompts and alerts to add some interactivity to the web page. Also I added some styles using css to make it more vital.
